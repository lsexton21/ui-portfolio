## A Typical Data Table

This is just one of many examples of a interactive data table for our admin and/or clients to set up their telecom network configurations.  Like this one, most tables will have dynamic values (such as counts, colors and tooltips) that change when configuration is altered and multiple buttons that open up other modals for advanced configuration.  This page alone uses about 20 instances of differenent classes to come together.
